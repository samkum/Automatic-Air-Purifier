We have used dust sensor whose output signal is analog. We converted analog into digital signal by connecting it to arduino. Analog signal gives us the density of dust particles or smoke which is detected by dust sensor.
The raw value of dust sensor is 1024 and the maximum rpm of fan is 255.Our code connect the raw value of dust sensor and speed of fan.Our code calculate the dust density and output voltage.Our code gives 2 output values on lcd.
